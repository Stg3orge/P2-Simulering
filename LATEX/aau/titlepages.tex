}{% the abstract
    This report is written for the 2nd semester project of group A319. The theme of the work done and described within this report is "Simulering" and shows the extensive work there has been done on analyzing and idenfitfying a problem within the field of simulations as well as describe the development of a solution to said problem. The report is split into two parts, the problem analysis in which the process of going from an initial problem-statement to a descriptive final problem-statement is documented. The second part of the report describes the developed solution and the the group's decisions that were taken when making the solution. Requirements and success-criteria were made according to the findings made in the problem analysis and the final problem-statement. Furthermore, this part of the report compares two shortest-path algorithms the group looked at for implementation of the program, A* and Dijkstra, and also details the decision made on this matter. Most importantly, this part also includes detailed descriptions of some of key parts of the developed program, as well as snippets of the sourcecode for these parts.}
